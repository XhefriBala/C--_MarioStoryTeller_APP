***I. A main objective & playing instructions***

I’m sure most of you have played Super Mario Bros at least once in your life.

As you know, the main objective of Super Mario is to save the princess from the evil King

Bowser Koopa.

Here is a brief story of the Nintendo game.

{

We first see Mario in the arcade game “Donkey Kong” as “Jumpman” (1981).

One year later, in 1982, we see Jumpman in “Donkey Kong Junior” and the character

is renamed Mario, and this is the only time where Jumpman (Mario) is the

antagonist of the game.

Finally, in 1983 the saga of Mario Bros began.

Mario and his brother Luigi are plumbers in Brooklyn, New York; they protect the

City from various creatures.

We don’t really know how, but later Mario will find the Mushroom Kingdom of

Princess Toadstool (renamed Peach just later in the years).

Here the evil King Koopa (Bowser) will kidnap the Princess and take the control of

the kingdom.

To save Princess Toadstool, Mario conquers the eight worlds of the Mushroom

Kingdom by going to the castle in each world to defeat a minion of King Koopa.

To reach each castle of the king, Mario travels across eight worlds to restore order to

the Mushroom Kingdom and to rescue Princess.

Finally, as a thank-you for rescuing her, the princess grants Mario with a kiss on the

cheek.

}

In this case, this is a Storyteller game, so the story has different ends, and you choose those

ends. ***HOW TO PLAY?***

Basically, at the start of the game, you will have a choice of where you want Mario to go,

left or right (A or B).

‘A’ will take Mario to one place and ‘B’ in another place with different story and so on.

To make it easier I drew a little diagram for you of the idea of this storyteller game.

***II. A reward for fulfilling the objective***

At stage 2, the player will have two options; A or B. ‘B’ is the one that saves the princess.

If you guess that at the first try, the princess will give Mario a kiss on the mouth, if not (so

on your second and last try) just a kiss on the chicks. (too late Mario sorry).

***III. A consequence for falling the objective***

If even at the second try the user inputs A, the evil King

Bowser will eat Mario and the Princess.

“Game Over”

***IV. A challenge for the players***

The only challenge for the player is decision-making to select the letter A or B. It’s pretty

easy, it’s just a funny story where you can decide the end of the Kingdom.

***V. Reasons for development***

I chose Mario Bros because it’s my favourite game ever. (together with Zelda)

I think Mario Bros is timeless.

I wanted to develop the real game but obviously is very difficult, and in C++ even more so.

So I chose a simple funny storytelling of Mario Bros, where at the same time i could improve

my skills on classes and functions of C++.

***VI. GUI***

I will use as welcome screen this:
